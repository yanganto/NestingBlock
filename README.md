# NestingBlock

This is program of modelling sidechain interaction of peptides in helix/coil states.

It can be easy to calculate the fraction helix of peptides based on Lifson-Roig theory by using following command:

$ python3 NestingBlock.py test-LifsonRoig

It also can list the equnation of equilibrium constant with specil force in the block within helix state by using following command:

$ python3 NestingBlock.py test-NestingBlock
