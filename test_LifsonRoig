# The protocol file is for NestingBlock.py
# All parameter is CASE SENSITIVE !!!

# Peptide sequence form n terminus to c terminus
#
# EX:
# sequence = "KAAAAKAAAAKAAAAKGGY"
sequence = "KAAEAKAAAAKAAAAKGGY"

# Epsilon value, in diple mode will concern it
# vacuum: 	1 	(by definition)
# water:	80	(at 20 Celsius degrees)
#
# EX:
# epsilon = 2.0
epsilon = 2.0

# The file path of wnc file, which contain all 
# wnc value.
# If some time the v value is residue depend, 
# the v value also define in this file
#
# EX:
# wncfilename = "./wnc"
wncfilename = "./wnc"

# Nesting Block modification
# Define the position of the pair and define
# the the variables.
# Position count start from ZERO !!!
# The variables can be any mount any character,
# CASE SENSITIVE !!!
# Need expermental Fraction helix (Fhelix_exp)
# to derive the equation
#
# EX:
#Fhelix_exp = 0.505
#pair.creat(0,3,'x')
#pair.creat(15,18,'y')

# Amid Bone Offset
# State helixity is number of helix residue divid
# by the maxima state helixity.
# Maxima state helixity is Amid bond number add
# amid bond offset.
# In RPC lab, we think the first and the last amid
# cant be helix, thus the amid bond offset is -2
#
# EX:
# amidOffSet = -2
amidOffSet = -2

# Calculate mode
# A string present the model use in calculation
# c, concern cap issue, which calculate with n and c value(modified Lifson-Roig)
# d, concern dipole issue
#
# EX:
# mod="cd"
mod="cd"
